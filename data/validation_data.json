worship arts and use this in my work but i hesitate to say i m only pro because amateur means you do something purely for the love of it and i feel that way about music so first the models i ve tested are far and away more realistic to my ears than other modelers i ve used which includes logic studio s amps these sound almost as good btw pod xlive and xtpro the hd models are noticeably better and the fizz is gone gone gone the original pod and   which sounded the same to me and made me happy at the time and the tonelab se which i missed for a while but not anymore i made a few patches for one of my guitars based on having a bassman x alongside the dr z and it is the coolest sound i ve ever made with this guitar easily better sounding to my ears than the real amps i ve been using maybe because i put them off stage and don t run them very loud i adore the sound of this unit oh and as always forget about all the pre sets they re probably all as useless as you imagine they might be now the bad news and it s significant for some first off editing is clunky like it was on the xt and xlive just forget about trying to use the display connect to a computer seriously when you start from an init patch you only get lucky it seems to manage to coax it into two amp config next the functionality of this unit is exaggerated by it s specs you will almost certainly not be able to do  fx at once the way you re thinking why let s say you use an xt or a x think about what you re used to you start with  fxsubtract effect banks for  volume pedal you need to use an effect bank you might be able to use an analog pedal but i like my volume after my compressor so i have to do it in the loop i guess  fx loop only works with an effect bank line is there any way you can make this always active in a firmware upgrade seems like you could  noise gate used to be always available don t worry if you mix this with the m as i plan to do though as the m has a great gate i mostly use clean or just barely broken up amps so i might be able to skip this  wah this is always available and active in the x and below  post eq the xlive had a final eq before final output that i liked a lot in addition to all the other fx too you need to dedicate an fx bank now so you might only have fx left for me put in a clean boost and tube drive which i think sound better in this box than they did in the m probably because they re digitally part of the signal is all i can think and a verb for the amp no slots left what if you need delay and modulation eek i have to re think the way i use fx in this box still evaluating how that will work for me what if you re a guy like me who was using the xlive occasionally as a one box solution for a dual voice guitar all my guitars have piezo bridges no dice i will have to use an acoustic preamp no matter i have one i will probably dedicate a null amp to bring this signal into the unit and mix it in addition there aren t as many computer recording routing options as the xlive and the super sweet ability to switch between two fx chains in one patch instead of switching programs is gone as far back as my old vox tonelab se i could literally switch channels from one amp cab to another in the same fx chain you could do something similar on the xlive not here also line  why on earth can t you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interface with this unit how complicated can that really be in short the xlive has significantly significantly more flexibility imho than this unit for many of us at least and ought not to have been discontinued imho for some of you it s still a viable option you also still might need your other fx i thought it might be possible that this unit even if i needed to use my ag stomp for my acoustic side again which i m happy to do would bump my m off the stage it did not at first but after a while i did indeed get rid of the m and don t miss it that said i think from what i m hearing that some of the fx especially the dirt pedals work far better inside this box than they do in the m when you connect it to a pod or amp my favorite patches so far that i ve made which use the bassman model and the unbelievable dr z model far and away my favorite amp model evah don t leave any room for modulation or other special fx i m not a switch whole patches on the fly guy i turn fx off and on but after a bit of tweaking and patch making i discovered that for my sounds i didn t need dual amp chains that often so i have all my flexibility back so am i complaining about these limitations no because the sound of this unit is so extraordinary i d take off a full star for this shortcoming but the fact is the unit sounds good enough that i can t do it there will at some point i hope be a next generation of this technology which will possibly address some of the usability shortcomings but i have to say for this price i am totally satisfied with the sound in the meantime am i willing to trade the flexibility of my former rig for the sound of this one heck yes it sounds that good i even love the models of amps i know i ll never use for the first time ever and after a few months of experimenting i was able to make patches that completely worked for my two voice guitar stuff with no additional outboard gear if i didn t want so i ve simplified to where i wanted to and no longer feel like i m really compromising anything so started with a rig consisting of the hd and sometimes an m and an acoustic preamp currently a yamaha ag stomp mixed in with the hd signal through the aux input i ve now gotten to the point where i can do everything i want if i need without the additional pedals and i sold the m i kept a few analog pedals and such that i just like but rarely take them out of the house anymore i m only nit picking so that you will know all the trade offs for what i have been fantasizing about basically an m in form and function with a handful of amp models shoved in the box this is as close as we re probably going to come and did i mention the sound it s seriously great update i have learned that i will indeed have no problem replacing my m as well and sold it off i thought i d miss it but i don t update as of february  i have supplemented this product with a black james tyler variax jtv korean and it s a marriage made in heaven if you are going to go with this product and if you are looking for a new guitar check out the new variaxes totally amazing","overall":5,"summary":"actually   stars but i rounded up great sounds the fizz is

master is and how we should evaluate it is it a toy or is it meant to be a serious bedroom amplifier do we review it compared only to other mini amps or do other small combos costing under  creep into the discussion well i bought one for myself and the conclusion is this it isn t the best way to practice guitar quietly at home but it s also also fun little product at an affordable price that sounds slightly better than you d expect appearance durability actually the aesthetics of the mini tone master are one of my favorite things about it this is a  conversation piece that i wouldn t mind having out on my work desk as a reminder of one of my favorite hobbies it just so happens that it s a functioning amplifier you can plug into and practice with also the component actually used to make the amplifier are cheap yet are put together in a convincing way take a step back and you d swear the hard plastic housing was actually vinyl or leather the grill cloth over the speakers is a nice facade for the hard plastic facing that protects the speakers actually while the amp is cheap it s also fairly durable in fact i just dumped it off my desk reaching over to write this review and it seems to be working fine phew it should also be noted that this amp is powered either by a v battery or a v dc adapter a boss pedal supply adapter will work for example while the battery option is obviously nice for portability the red on light seemed noticeably dimmer with v s and i can t say how long the battery will last if you plan to have it in one place most of the time the adapter is the preferred way to go sound the concept of this amp is pretty ridiculous if you think about it a one watt output with twin  speakers given that each speaker is smaller than the tweeter on a large stereo speaker you won t be surprised at all to hear that there s virtually no bass in the sound it sounds like a poor w solid state amp only shrunk down to a few inches at the same time that s kind of a remarkable feat for a miniature amplifier and it puts out a fair amount of sound i opted for the mini tone master over some other options because it actually has a fair range of tones low gain high volume produces pretty good clean tones and with humbuckers and the gain turned up it can get a bit raunchy unfortunately the tone control either does nothing or behaves completely irrationally i haven t figured out which yet i had it at  most of the time but it didn t seem to cut much treble as i turned it up actually it got the brightest around  and then almost became more muffled beyond that but again for a  mini amp my expectations were not that much to begin with i do like the four knobs and the decision to make the power knob the same size as the other knobs was a subtle touch that prevents the cheaper feel of an on off flat toy switch i expected the speaker to overdrive break up if you pushed it too hard and not in a tube like manner that wasn t necessarily the case but there are other problems something internally rattles after the volume goes above  and it s not the speaker being overpowered this is a common issue with cheap amps and i might even pop it open to see what is rattling around and the sound quality isn t objectively good by any means but it is good enough to play amplified electric guitar and to hear the basic characteristics of your instrument and playing style alternatives the primary reason i rated this  instead of  really isn t any of the issues above i am happy with the amp but it s limited usefulness compared to the many alternatives for home quiet practicing my favorite of these by far are the vox amplugs which are headphone jacks stylized after different famous amplifiers the sound quality those things pump into your headphones is of far greater quality and volume fullness than anything this mini amp could do also they are offered at  or  so it s simply a better value another alternative is to plug into a smartphone and practice with software while sound quality and volume are often a problem with smartphone apps the possibilities for effects modeling and recording are endless if you think about recent improvements in small size bluetooth speakers you realize that the sound quality on a device of this size could be far better than what the mini tone master offers at the same time those speakers can cost up to  and premium sound quality was never the point of this amp your opinion of it will depend on your expectations but if you don t take it too seriously it s a cool little device and in my book anything that allows you to practice more guitar than you would otherwise is nothing to laugh at","overall":4,"summary":"cool novelty item that happens to be a halfway decent mini

would expect a w amp to be but seems well put together controlsthe iii comes with a  button foot pedal which feels very solid and works perfectly you can expand to add an optional  button switch that fender sells separately and also includes in the iv and v on the amp you have separate eq knobs treble mids and low you have a gain a volume a master volume and a reverb along with these you also have an lcd screen that tells you which amp model you are using with witch pedals presets delays and reverbs you also have separate buttons for changing amp models reverb delays and modulation effects the large knob on the top actually scrolls through presets and once you press it you can go into deep editing of the amp models effects and presets the controls are intuitive and easy to use it is a great mix of visual digital feedback as well as tactile knobs comparing to other amps the fender gdec  does not have as much deep editing available on the amp itself you need to use your computer to edit and download settings properly but on the mustang iii you do not feel that you are missing out on editing functionality by not keeping it plugged into a computer i don t know of another amp that has controls that are both as intuitive and as powerful the sound most important let me first compare this amp to what line  vox and peavy have offered in the past all of the companies that have gone heavy into the amp modeling offer endless numbers of sounds and effects but how many of those sounds are useful for guitarists who are learning and trying to create sounds based on music that has inspired them line  offers tons of sounds most of them are what i would call niche sounds that are only useful when recording a weird intro or some crazy effects laden sound what i find with line  is that their vintage tones are very digital sounding and sound over processed they don t sound overdriven they just sound distorted also line  offers oodles of sounds for progressive rock metal and maybe even some weird jazz fusion these sounds are unique and interesting but the vast majority are of no use to someone like me who is learning to play the songs that i love and looking for useful rock blues and metal tones what i can say about the mustang iii is that the tones do not sound digital or overly processed the vintage amps have some great overdriven types of sounds these are very passable sounds and fantastic models of the real thing you can find the actual base amp models in memory banks   by playing these sounds you get a real feel of what you can do to the amps a few of the sounds that are simply amazing to me are  champ this amp model sounds so convincingly cool just like a little  inch champ tons of character and tone you can get some really cool vintage type blues sounds through this amp model think the jimi blues cd the presets that use this amp that fender created are all really fun and sound amazing fender bassman wow you can get some great bold rock sounds out of this amp model it has the recognizable tone of the bassman modeled really well big bold bottom end with some singing highs  deluxe is a fantastic all purpose amp model throw an overdrive pedal on there and play some great classic rock blues or leave it alone for a beautiful clean tone the british amps are all good models of vox and marshall type amps they are all bold and in your face just play one acdc riff into the  s amp and you ll recognize the sound as far as the vintage tones go i dare you to find anything that models vintage tones this well anywhere if you play rock blues country hard rock or jazz you have so many great choices people who play in churches will love the variety of clean tones for your lighter stuff and good overdriven rock tones for faster paced songs what surprises me is that fender has strongly marketed this amp for people who play heavy music i was worried that the heavier amp models would not be nearly as good i was wrong the  s stack can get nice and grungy or crunchy as you like it i m pretty sure that this is a mesa boogie type of model this is certainly your metallica amp the  metal is for all of your nu metal needs and can be pulled back a little to play some cool thrash sounds too the big bonus for heavy guitarists in my opinion though is the supersonic this amp has a lot of great character and you can make it bluesy or really make it heavy and bold to play metal thrash or whatever if you overdrive it with a built in pedal you can get some great raw and heavy tones out of this i play some metal and hard rock as well as the classic and blues stuff that i like i personally will play all of my heavy stuff on this supersonic amp the fact that you can take any of these basic amps and layer effects and pedals on them gives you absolutely infinite combinations of tones you can have one guy who sets all  presets with vintage tones and another guy who has all of the presets filled with metal and thrash it is limitless i would without a doubt choose this amp over any modeling amp out there for practice and fun i own a pimped out mim strat and a off the rack classic vibe strat and tele as well as a les paul style guitar they all sound very cool on this amp the classic vibe  s strat really impresses me through this amp so versatile with so many great sounds and such a high quality sound i am really loving it this amp can play really really loud with it s  watts but you can also play it with great tone at very low volumes i have  kids and practice at night and this amp is perfect fender fuse and ableton softwarei have to admit that i really don t feel a lot of need to dive too much deeper into sound editing than what i can do manually on the amp however you ll find amazing tones all over the fender fuse the system is super easy to use and store on your amp as with any open online forum you will have to wade through tones that you don t love and aren t described well but you will find some gems too i have not had time to dive into the ableton recording software yet so i will have to save that review for later the final wordi am a father of  who needs an amp that sounds great at low volumes i like vintage tones as much as heavy stuff so i like a variety of tones i hate overprocessed guitar tones this amp is perfect for me perfect the amp models are great and the factory installed presets are a great variety of usable sounds it comes with a built in tuner tap tempo effects a two button footswitch an effects loop a digital interface deep editing computer software a headphone jack a usb port recording software and moreat  this amp costs less than effects pedals that friends of mine have purchased i have a  strat that i love that sounds beautiful through it after buying it i have listed a tube amp and several effects pedals that i have loved because i no longer will play it there is no better modeling amp for my needs","overall":5,"summary":"best modeling amp for vintage
