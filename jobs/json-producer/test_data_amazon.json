standard pj bassbeen playing  years i had a squier bullet and it was a cheap guitar i didn t care about that i could keep next to the couch to play rocksmith with but it got old and i wore the frets out so i needed a new cheap guitar for rocksmith i picked up the lp special  in black at guitar center for  and they kicked in free strings bought it for a game but soon found myself using it more than my other guitars because it sounded so good played so well and had a killer tone my lp studio had it s pickups replaced with the zakk wylde   s which made for good metal but it lost some of that bluesy tone that passives have imagine my delight when my inexpensive epiphone had great sustain tone and playability considering this thing is almost the same prices a bullet squier it is easily twice the guitar for that price you literally cannot find a better guitar for  than the special  sound  two passive humbuckers have a great sound with glossy highs deep lows and they put just the right amount of dirt on a tone for a gutsy clean or distorted sound the pickups were wax dipped and did not have the microphone feedback effect the pickups are high output and feel like alnico more than ceramic not sure which they have so much sustain for a bolt on neck i was shocked build quality  i did have  problem with the high e tuner i didn t notice in the store but the string peg was   up out of the headstock when i discovered this i loosened the string whacked it with my fret hammer and it popped right in and stayed that way intonation required no adjustment action was exactly the way i like itneck was straight with no fret buzz or excessive bow the finish was perfect no nicks blemishes just oily black goodness neck was flush with no gaps or seams and professionally shimmed damn good for a bolt on hardware is typical for the price but does the job stays in tune very well back bending headstock and x orientation mean no string trees which makes tuning much more stable the bridge is similar to my lp studio with the tunamatic setup individual strings may be intonated but action is done with two nuts ie can raise one side higher or lower but not individual strings weird having the toggle between the volume knobs but i soon got used to it no pickguard and it doesn t need one lots of relief between strings and body you won t find yourself hitting the pickup housings or body with the pick makes it easy to clean too truss rod is behind a nice body color plate frets were smooth rounded and played nice could use a little buffing for silky smooth but not rough neck plays fast but the nut took some getting used to i would catch it on my hand when fretting at the top soon got used to it and it wasn t an issue k pots and side body   trplug keeps the cable out of the way overall  came with hex keys for setupcame with an awsome poster with all the epiphone guitar modelscame with a nice bumper stickerno manualbody was packed in foam shroud with foam blocks about the same as any other  guitar summary this guitar is the best bang for the buck of any instrument i own it sounds good enough to gig with out of the box it s well built plays well and if you treat it well it should give you years of great music the frets are medium jumbo s and a little deeper than a fender meaning they should last longer before needing re fretting than a typical affinity or bullet  squiers in this price range i would say this guitar is suitable for all styles of music i did blues metal country and pop the pickups are humbuckers which means they are darker and higher output than a fender not as much of those nice fender bell like tones and chime but it makes up for it with power and clarity one thing i like about epiphones and gibsons is the volume pot is not close to the bridge this makes it very easy to palm mute and play with high gain i lay my pinky and the knife edge of my hand lightly across the strings right where they hit the bridge and it makes a nice mute but on my strats the damn volume knob is in the way as an experiment i took the pick up pole scews out of the bottom pickup to see if i could get a single coil sound out of it what happened was a mess because of the parafin wax which got everywhere the tone was a little brighter and output a little lower still no hum but you wouldn t fool anyone into thinking it was a single coil i ended up putting the screws back in i will likely put my lp studio stock pickups back in hell yeah coil tapping here i come and move my emg   s in this lp special  and make myself a nice little metal guitar do yourself a favor buy this guitar even if you already have a better guitar it s cheap enough that you won t care if you bang it around a little and good enough that you will enjoy playing it for many

consumer speakers they are a bit understated and without bass bloat or exaggerated highs i e teen eq the even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours it also lacks a midrange bump and sounds a bit recessed or laid back compared to average earbuds or home speakers in fact the bx sounds similar to my sennheiser hd headphones but with less lower bass and that s a good thing for mixing as you don t want speakers that add color and or bumps in the frequency response unlike typical passive stereo speakers the bx is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer i e bi amped this design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver the downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing at first the bx struck me as underpowered for a  watt rating at least with a signal directly from my mac pro however once jacked into the hotter signal from my motu ultralite the true power of the bx was revealed it was loud and could be painfully so if cranked these are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out your head should form a triangle with the two speakers that diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is mia in fact unlike most speakers there is little rearwards projection perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties so don t buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use i mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings live and multitrack so the bass range is perfect for me the bass extends down to a clear hz so plenty ump for drop d and drop c tuning if you mix bass guitar and kick drum you ll want larger speakers bx or a sub but these are great for guitar i m used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass mid and highs for different room responses and taste oddly the pdf instructions show eq switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers i assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure rfi resistance i m an inner city dweller and live in a high rfi area cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes so one of the major selling points for me was m audio s claim of rfi shielding luckily that was no mere marketing jive they really are well shielded against rfi not a single wayward drum loop or dj in my tracks not even when cranked i can t make that claim for prior speakers i ve owned heat these speakers run on the warm side the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips it has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat however i have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions i live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up not a deal breaker but it s wise to turn them off when not in use i use a power strip so i don t have to flip two separate switches construction these are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed cinema display and motu ultralite construction appears very good with dense particle board mdf cabs metal back plate heat sink benefit and matching plastic front molding around the drivers the cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl these monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver the bass drivers are kevlar with rubber surrounds tougher than foam and the tweeters sport silk domes no protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors so the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick connections like most studio monitors the bx comes with pro audio style jacks for   inch phone plug trs and xlr if you re a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks rca or usb so you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters if you re an experienced recordist you should have plenty of these cables laying around but otherwise be prepared to reach for your wallet one of the things i like about the bx is both the trs and xlr connections are active at the same time allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches i have an audioengine d dac connected to the trs phone input for itunes movies games etc while a motu ultralite for mixing tracking is plugged into the xlr connection last blurb yes the small focal speakers i listened to were better sounding and louder than the bx but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches however a perfect monitor for a home studio isn t only about a good neutral sound but also about compactness appearance and value and the bx nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine","overall":5,"summary":"jim dandy n
